== Projeto Pipa



== Getting Started

1.Before you start the rake command please comment the last line of config/gsm.rb
2.Then you rake db:migrate 
3.No "uncomment" the last line.

== Oberservations
1. Note that in Gemfile i call my rubygsm gem, because it calls directly my User Methods, 
because i couldnt pass this method as an argument to the original gem.
